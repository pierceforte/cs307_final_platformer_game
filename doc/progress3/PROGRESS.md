- Describe how much of the planned features were completed this Sprint and what helped or impeded progress
    - In this sprint, we made a lot of progress regarding the overall design of our game, testing, and some implementations. Overall, we were really happy with this progress since we can finally see our game taking shape and have written extensible, flexible code that will allow for creating new features. Our frequent team meetings helped us complete work, even despite our many other commitments as this semester comes to an end.
    - We are very proud of how our game loads and displays data. By this sprint, each level has a json file associated with the level layout, and a bank json that tells the GameSequenceController what items go in the bank. There are three main json files that are used in the setup right now. Levels has all of the information for the default layout of a level like stationary platforms and enemies. Bank has all of the objects that will be available for purchase in the bank and how much they cost, how big they are etc. User contains all of the information for each user like how much money they have, their prefered avatar, and all of their high scores.  We also implemented a light and a dark mode of the game. 
- Describe a specific significant event that occurred this Sprint and what was learned from it
    - A significant event we’ve had was figuring out how to do our step function as our game gets bigger and more complicated. The challenge is whether or not to use game action classes to help facilitate movement when multiple objects are insecting or whether to just use the normal step function and handle intersections as the step function encounters them.  We’ve decided to go with the step function for now but are also trying to keep functionality to use the game action objects in the future. 
- Describe what worked, what did not, and something specific that is planned for improvement next Sprint
    - While we have implemented our step animation method, because our datapath involves making images from json files, then creating those images into GameObjects, and then updating how those GameObjects are displayed every time, our program is quite laggy. We aim to improve our game’s runtime by implementing for this upcoming deadline a technique recommended to us by our TA: to first make a HashMap of pre-made Images, so that when we read from our json file that an object needs to be made, we can first check to see if there is one already ready to go. Otherwise, our Levels have two clearly defined stages like we planned, the BLUEPRINT stage and the Play stage, and our levels load like we intended them too.
- What features are planned to be completed during the next Sprint (taking into account what was done this Sprint), who will work on each feature, and any concerns that may complicate the plan
    - During the next Sprint, we plan to pull the different aspects of our game together and have them interact properly. We have each dedicated a lot of time to our individual responsibilities, but it has been a little tricky to handle dependencies, which is where we will now focus our efforts.
    - For new features, we would like to implement the HUD for the user, implement a character selection stage, apply physics to the game’s characters, better handle object interactions, and design more levels. 
    - Pierce plans to implement the HUD and improve the backend, Nicole plans to add to the frontend and handle menus/UI, Ben plans to work further with reading in data and refactoring the backend, and Jerry plans to finish the step engine.
