- Completed Work
  - In this first sprint, we completed making the basic structure of our program and the basic code necessary for further extensions. This work mainly includes the creation of our package hierarchy, a method for creating "pages" for the game, a way to build game objects and define their rules, a way to interact with a server and share information, and a way to run the game's "engine" with a stepping function. Our progress was, however, primarily impeded by other assignments we each had this week. In particular, we each had midterms we needed to study for, which made it difficult to complete as much work as we would have liked â€“ mainly handling the interaction among our project's features and writing tests.
- A significant event that happened this Sprint was the difficulties we faced in importing libraries. Trying to communicate this information was rather difficult over Zoom, and because different people had different issues, we had a little trouble implementing tests (which relied on Maven imports) and implementing the online server feature.
- What worked well here was our implementation of a basic Game skeleton; however, we had trouble reading in game states from files as well as interacting among classes. We hope to fix these issues by communicating more about what each of our classes need from each other and how to best pass around these objects/information.
- During the next sprint, we plan to fully implement the online Google Firebase server (Ben), refactor and implement more Pages and transitions among scenes to support extensions regarding Level stages and menus (Nicole), create the Blueprint stage before levels begin and implement more objects on the backend (Pierce), and complete the game's engine (stepping and graphical updates).
