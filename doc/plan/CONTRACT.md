#Team Contract for the Snizard Team

#Basically:
Do your work, communicate, attend and interact during team meetings.

##To repeat previous assignment agreements, as a project team we:
1) Promise to respect each otherâ€™s ideas and work.
2) Promise to be active team members and do our fair share of the work as best as we can.
3) Promise to do our work on time or communicate proactively with the team if there will be a delay.
4) Promise to help our fellow team members when they need it.
5) Promise to communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.

Together, we are all dedicated to committing a significant amount of time to the project, hopefully resulting in a game that is of publishable quality. We are willing to spend time each day and will communicate frequently through Zoom meetings. Likewise, given the circumstances with COVID-19, we will also be considerate of the issues each teammate might face and are willing to help each other as we complete this project.
